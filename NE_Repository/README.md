ARIADNE REPOSITORY
==================
_The Repository component of the ARIADNE infrastructure._

**ARIADNE** has created a standards-based technology **infrastructure** that allows the **publication and management** of **digital learning resources** in an open and scalable way. The vision that drives the continuous development of this infrastructure is to provide flexible, effective and efficient access to **large-scale educational collections** in a way that goes beyond what typical search engines provide. ARIADNE was initially set up by a network of European stakeholders, expanding now into a global network of member institutions sharing the same vision.
